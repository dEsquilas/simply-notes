## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run SimpleNotes on your local machine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dEsquilas/simply-notes.git
   cd simplenotes
   ```
   
2. **Create a new `.env` file:**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

Simply notes uses a MySQL database by default. You can change the database settings in the `.env` file to match your local environment.

For the login system, it's used the Google Authentication system. You should fill the values ([link](https://developers.google.com/identity/gsi/web/guides/get-google-api-clientid?hl=es-419)):

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URL=

You can get these values by creating a new project in the Google Developer Console and enabling the Google+ API. You should add the redirect URL to the authorized redirect URIs in the Google Developer Console. Default redirect URL is `<your host>/google/callback`.

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   composer install
   pnpm install
   ```
   
At this point, if you're planning to use it in your local, you can use [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail) for execute whole commands
   
4. **Generate an application key:**
   ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```
   
5. **Run the migrations:**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```
   
6. **Compile the assets:**
   ```bash
    pnpm run build
    ```
